# Earthquake-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
a jupyter notebook on earthquake dataset.

Earthquake prediction system using latitude and longitude value system can predict the magnitude of the earthquake that could occur on that place. The dataset used for this problem is manually entried and some are collected from Kaggel. The dataset is provided here.

For explanatory data analysis following graphs are used-
1. Histogram
2. Scatter Plot
3. KDE plot
4. Swarmplot
5. Stripplot
6. Box Plot
7. Countplot

For eleminating important categorical value problem 'One hot Encoding' has been applied.

The system has been build using 80% data for trainning and 20% data for testing. 3 different type of Machine Learning algorithm has been integrated to predict the magnitude. Such as-
1. Random Forest
2. XGBoost
3. Gradient Boost

TO get optimal result by hyperparameter tuning followed procedure has been used-
1. Grid CV
2. Randomized Search CV

Explainable A.I has also been integrated using the Random Forest model.
